## Problem Statement: Understanding ArrayList and its methods ##

**This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique**

- Test classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors, when the exercise is cloned locally
- Classes and methods should be created by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors
- Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass
- Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below

- In this problem, player elements are added to ArrayList and various methods are returning the list after
  sorting and filtering.
        
         Add player elements to ArrayList and returns it
         Sorts and returns the players by case insensitive name in ascending order
         Sorts and returns the players by score in descending order, if scores are same sort by playerId in ascending order
         Filters the players who scored greater than fifty and returns the list sorting by score in descending order 
         Filters the players who played in same match and returns the list sorting by name in ascending order
   

## Instructions
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected output as given in sample
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Do not change the provided class/method names unless instructed
- Follow best practices while coding
